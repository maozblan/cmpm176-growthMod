# cmpm176-growthMod (GREED)
this is a class project, modification on the game Growth from crisp-game-lib; [original source code for GROWTH](https://github.com/abagames/crisp-game-lib-11-games/blob/main/docs/growth/main.js), [playable GROWTH game](https://abagames.github.io/crisp-game-lib-11-games/?growth).

## Playable Modifications

This modification adds a laser. Below are 4 versions, we recommend you starting with the Base Mod before exploring any others.

[Base Mod](https://maozblan.github.io/cmpm176-growthMod/?suramya): This is the standard game with a flashing laser and normal speed enemies. Try hitting the laser to get a better score but watch out as, when it turns red ……. you're dead. (Note enemies don’t get too big when the laser is low)

[Alternate Lasers](https://maozblan.github.io/cmpm176-growthMod/?lyssa): Our laser broke. We had to use a different one. We don't trust this one really.

[Tough mode](https://maozblan.github.io/cmpm176-growthMod/?sam): more the points, but even more the speed, can you hit 50k?

[No bounds](https://maozblan.github.io/cmpm176-growthMod/?joseph): yea the enemies can get big and the laser can go really low. If you think it's unfair…… because it is (more points tho, test out your RNG)
